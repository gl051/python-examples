# Why to use pathlib ?

When you have to interact with the file system, python provides a very convenient module named `pathlib`.
Pathlib is an object oriented interface to the files system and provides a more intuitive method to interact with the filesystem in a platform agnostic and pythonic manner.
You use an object (Path) to work with the file system and you can chain commands as needed.
