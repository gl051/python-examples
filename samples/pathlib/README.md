# Why to use pathlib ?

When you have to interact with the file system, python provides a very convenient module named `pathlib`.
Pathlib is an object oriented interface to the files system and provides a more intuitive method to interact with the filesystem in a platform agnostic and pythonic manner.
Many of the related `os` utilities are provided with methods on the `Path` object, you can then chain commands as needed.
